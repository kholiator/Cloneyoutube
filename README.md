# Cloneyoutube

This project is a clone of the YouTube user interface built with React.js, Tailwind CSS, and API integration. It allows users to view a list of predefined video thumbnails, click on a thumbnail to play the video, and see basic information about each video such as the title and description. The project utilizes the [Internship Service API](https://internship-service.onrender.com/videos?page=2) to fetch videos in a paginated manner, with buttons to navigate to the next and previous pages.

## Requirements

- React Components: The app effectively utilizes React components to manage and maintain state and props.
- User Interface: The app features a clean and intuitive user interface, making it easy to browse and play videos.
- Video Playback: Video playback is implemented using HTML5 video or a library like react-player, with the ability to retrieve videos from a public API or local data.
- State Management: The app properly manages the state of the video list and the currently selected/playing video.
- Responsiveness: The design is responsive and works seamlessly on various screen sizes and devices.
